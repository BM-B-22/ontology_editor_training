# Wine ontology exercises

* Write DL queries for:
   * wines that are made from Nebiollo grapes 
   * wines from Piedmont
  

* Add a term for Chardonnay (wine).  What does the reasoner classify as Chardonay?
* View the relationships (subClassOf axioms) of Chianti (wine).  How might these frustrate attempts to classify wines using the pattern you just used to define Chardonay wine?  

* Add a term for [Rose wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ros%C3%A9) or [orange wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_wine) and some terms for specific wines that will be auto-classified under it.
